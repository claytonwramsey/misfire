= RuBullet

This is a Rust implementation of PyBullet.
In other words, it uses the Bullet C API in order to expose a functionality that is similar to PyBullet.
Development is ongoing and functionality is currently limited.

== Status

This is currently highly experimental and largely composed of hacks.
Additionally, while this does expose a safe API, the internals are a large heap of unsafe code.
It can serve as a starting point for future work but should not be used in production now.
